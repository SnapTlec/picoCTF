picoCTF is a free computer security education program with original content built on a capture-the-flag framework created by security and privacy experts at Carnegie Mellon University.

Gain access to a safe and unique hands on experience where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, and think creatively and critically to solve the challenges and capture the flags.

Participants learn to overcome sets of challenges from six domains of cybersecurity including general skills, cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, etc. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.
